# Shop-Management---Java
Shop Management using AbstractDAO, ConnectionFactory and Reflection Technique

The objective of this project is to design and implement a program that will be used in processing orders. These orders will come from certain customers, who will want to buy products in certain quantities from the store. The products can be found in the store's stock in sufficient or insufficient quantities. Orders are defined by a specific customer who places them, the name of the product, the quantity that wants to be purchased and the location where the order will be delivered. Customers are defined by name, phone number and location.
After placing an order and making it, the purchased products will be deducted from the store's stock. We also have the opportunity to refresh the stock. All this information will be stored in a database, which will be refreshed in real time at each operation on the tables, namely, insertion, deletion and update.
